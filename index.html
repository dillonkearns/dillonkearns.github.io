            Hi, I'm Dillon. I'm an agile coach.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Agile is about delivering the right thing faster. Not by producing more,
            but by doing smaller pieces more frequently, and continuously learning.
            I help make teams happier and more effective by coaching them through
            their adoption of agile.
        </p>
