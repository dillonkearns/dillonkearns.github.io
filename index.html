    <p>
      I'm Dillon, I write software and work with teams to improve process
      and bootstrap Agile for their businesses.

    <p>
      I apply my experience working as a Scrum Master and Software Engineer to
      building apps iteratively from the ground up, and helping teams develop
      and improve their agile process.
