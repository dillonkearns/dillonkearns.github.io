            Hi, I'm Dillon. I'm an Agile Coach.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Collaboration is natural in a small startup environment. Yet as companies grow, structures and policies start to get in the way. Teams may be unsure how to work together towards shared goals. I coach growing businesses on how to collaborate effectively to deliver great results using Agile principles and practices.
